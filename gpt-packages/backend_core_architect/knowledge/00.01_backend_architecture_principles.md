## Backend Architecture Principles

## Separation of Concerns

Divide the system into distinct layers: presentation, business logic, data access.

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interface and API endpoints
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains core application logic
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions

## Scalability Patterns

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase server capacity
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across servers
- **Caching**: Use Redis/Memcached for frequently accessed data

## Maintainability

- Use modular design with clear interfaces
- Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use version control and CI/CD pipelines

## Security First

- Implement authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS and encrypt sensitive data
- Validate all inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
