## Database Design Patterns

## Relational Databases

### Normalization

- **1NF**: Eliminate repeating groups
- **2NF**: Remove partial dependencies
- **3NF**: Remove transitive dependencies
- **BCNF**: Boyce-Codd normal form for complex keys

### Indexing Strategies

- Primary keys automatically indexed
- Foreign keys should be indexed
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Avoid over-indexing to prevent write performance issues

## NoSQL Databases

### Document Stores (MongoDB)

- Embed related data for read-heavy workloads
- Use references for normalized data
- Schema flexibility for evolving data models

### Key-Value Stores (Redis)

- Simple key-value pairs for caching
- TTL for temporary data
- Pub/sub for messaging

### Graph Databases (Neo4j)

- Relationships as first-class citizens
- Complex queries with traversals
- Social networks, recommendations

## Hybrid Approaches

- Polyglot persistence: Use multiple database types
- CQRS: Separate read and write models
- Event sourcing: Store state changes as events
